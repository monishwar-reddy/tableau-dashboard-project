Customer Shield: Proactive Churn Prediction Dashboard
📌 Overview

Customer Shield is a Tableau Next–powered dashboard integrated with Salesforce that helps businesses predict and prevent customer churn before it happens.
It brings together support data, sales trends,etc into one place, giving managers the insights needed to act early and retain high-value customers.

🚨 Problem

Many businesses lose customers because:

Customer churn signals are scattered across multiple systems

Support cases are not linked with sales performance or satisfaction trends

Teams react too late instead of acting proactively

This leads to higher acquisition costs and reduced lifetime value.

💡 Solution

Customer Shield provides a single-pane dashboard to:

Track KPI Cards: Avg. Resolution Time, Avg. CSAT Score, Churn Risk %

Visualize Trends: CSAT over time, Open vs. Closed cases, Renewal trends

Filter data by Region, Industry, or Account Manager

Highlight Top 10 At-Risk Customers with suggested actions

Generate AI-powered Insights such as “3 customers need immediate follow-up.”
